## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on Kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `3.0.0`, `2.9.0`, `2.8.0`, `2.7.0`

## How to use this image
This `hook` image is intended to work in combination with other `parser` images to read or manipulate `findings` results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/hook-persistence-dependencytrack
```

## What is "Persistence Dependency-Track" Hook about?
The Dependency-Track persistenceProvider hook saves all generated CycloneDX SBOMs into the configured [OWASP Dependency-Track][dependencytrack.org] instance, other findings or SPDX SBOMs cannot be handled and are ignored.
This allows automatically cataloging infrastructure to gain an overview over the used components and dependencies.
To learn more about Dependency-Track visit [dependencytrack.org].

To use the _secureCodeBox_ to generate SBOMs, you can use the [Trivy-SBOM scanner][trivy-sbom].
